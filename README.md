## 🎮 Tic Tac Toe

A classic game of Tic Tac Toe built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum.
The goal of this project is to structure JavaScript Code using **factory functions** and the **module pattern**, 
ensuring a clean separation between game logic and user interface.
